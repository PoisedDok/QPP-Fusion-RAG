It guarantees the free exercise of religion and forbids Congress from passing laws that impede these freedoms. The amendment consists of two parts: the Establishment Clause, which prevents the government from establishing an official religion, and the Free Exercise Clause, which protects individuals' rights to practice their religion freely. The amendment also includes the right to peaceably assemble, petition for redress of grievances, and prohibits laws that restrict these freedoms. The interpretation of the First Amendment has evolved over time, with the Supreme Court applying it to states through incorporation via the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as seen in cases like Gitlow v. New York (1925).",
