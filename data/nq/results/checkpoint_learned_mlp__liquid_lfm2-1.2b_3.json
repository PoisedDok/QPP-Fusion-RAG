          "answer": "The Ming dynasty had a centralized imperial government. Although there was some decentralization of state power within provinces, the trend of central government officials delegating to provinces as virtual provincial governors began in the 1420s, and by the late Ming dynasty, officials were delegated to two or more provinces as supreme commanders and viceroys. The Ming administration utilized Grand Secretaries to assist the emperor, handling paperwork under the reign of the Yongle Emperor and later appointed as top officials of agencies.",
