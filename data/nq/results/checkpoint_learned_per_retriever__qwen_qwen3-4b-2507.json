It is typically reported as a separate component of equity and reflects the minority shareholders' ownership stake. This amount is not controlled by the parent company and thus does not allow the parent to exercise control over the subsidiary's operations. The NCI is adjusted in the consolidated balance sheet to reflect the fair value of the minority interest in the subsidiary's net assets.",

This reconciliation occurs in Season 6, following Willow's descent into darkness and the emotional turmoil caused by Tara's death, though the specific episode of reconciliation is not explicitly detailed in the provided context. However, the context indicates that their relationship is restored after Tara's departure and ongoing efforts to help Willow. \n\nMore directly, in Document 4, it states: \"Displeased with how Willow abuses her power, especially toward herself, Tara leaves Willow while continuing to counsel Dawn and Buffy. Long after Tara's death, Willow faces the choices she made... In the Season Eight episode 'Anywhere But Here', Willow tells Buffy that she is responsible for Tara's death. Her ambition to bring back Buffy from the dead inevitably led to Tara getting shot and killed.\" This implies that after Tara's death, Willow reflects on her actions and the relationship ends, but there is no mention of a reconciliation after Tara's death. \n\nTherefore, based on the documents, Willow and Tara reconcile after Tara leaves due to Willow's addiction, which occurs",
